NAME
    Kwiki::Theme::PerlMongers - A theme for Perl Mongers websites

SYNOPSIS
    In your Kwiki's plugins file simply use "Kwiki::Theme::PerlMongers"
    instead of "Kwiki::Theme::Basic". Add a line to your config.yaml like
    this:

     group_name: My Perl Mongers

    That's it!

DESCRIPTION
    I wanted to make the Minneapolis PM site a wiki, but thought it'd be
    nice to have a Perl Mongers theme.
